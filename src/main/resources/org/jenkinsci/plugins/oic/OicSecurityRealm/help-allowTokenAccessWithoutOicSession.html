    Enabling this functionality allows Jenkins API token based access even if the associated user has
    completly logged out from Jenkins and the OIC Provider.

    The default behavior is to require any Jenkins API token based access to have an valid OIC session user
    session associated with it.  This means that the user associated with the Jenkins API token <ul>must</ul>
    be logged in via the UI in order to use an API token for Jenkins CLI access.
